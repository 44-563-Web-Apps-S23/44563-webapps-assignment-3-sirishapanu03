        <h2> Basketball</h2>
        <p>Basketball is my favourite team sport. It can be played by people of all ages.
           <b>We dont need anything except a hoop and a ball to practice it.</b> 
            It can be played with 5 team members or as less as one to two people and still have the same fun.
            It's a <b>great pastime</b> for any one and is a great way to bond with family members and friends.
            It is a sport that can work your whole body. It is a fast-paced game with lots of <b>running 
            and jumping</b>, hence we can burn calories. </p>
